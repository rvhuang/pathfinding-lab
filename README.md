A playground where you can run, test and compare pathfinding algorithms and heuristic functions. 

Visit [the website](https://pathfinding-lab.codedwith.fun/) running on DigitalOcean and try it out.

The project is written in ASP.NET Core MVC/Web API and TypeScript. The algorithm part of the project is based on [LINQ to A\*](https://github.com/rvhuang/linq-to-astar): a POC about pathfinding algorithms written in C# and used with LINQ expressions.

## Features

* An editable, retro RPG-style map where you can place various obstacles, creating whatever maze you want.
* Five algorithms and three heuristic functions available for playing with (more to be added).
* Right-clicking on two positions to find a path (can be undone).
* An overlay grid with animation to show expanded nodes and depths(levels).
* A line chart that fully illustrates the evolution of Open List during the process.
* A code snippet that demonstrates LINQ statement using LINQ to A*.
